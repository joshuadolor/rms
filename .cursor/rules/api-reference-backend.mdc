# API reference – backend

When you add or change an **API endpoint** in this project:

1. **Update `docs/API-REFERENCE.md`** so it stays the single source of truth.
2. For each new or changed endpoint, add or edit the entry with:
   - Method and path (e.g. `POST /api/...`)
   - Auth required? (No / Bearer / Bearer + verified)
   - Rate limit if any
   - Request body (fields and validation)
   - Response shape (200/201 and error responses)
3. Add a short line to the **Changelog** at the bottom of `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` with the date and what changed.

This keeps the frontend (and frontend agents) aligned with the backend API.

# API reference – frontend

When you work on **API calls** from the frontend (login, register, fetch user, etc.):

1. **Read `docs/API-REFERENCE.md`** first. It is the single source of truth for:
   - Base URL and auth (Bearer token)
   - Every endpoint: method, path, request body, response shape, errors (422, 401, 403)
   - User payload shape, validation rules, and generic messages (e.g. forgot-password, resend verification)
2. Use the documented request/response shapes and error formats. Do not assume endpoints or field names; follow the doc.
3. Handle documented error cases (e.g. "Please verify your email address before logging in.", 403 for unverified on protected routes).

This keeps the frontend consistent with the backend and avoids mismatched payloads or missing error handling.

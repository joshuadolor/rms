# Frontend: Mobile-first

When working on the **frontend** (Vue components, views, layouts, styles):

1. **Prioritize mobile-first.** Design and implement for small screens first, then enhance for larger breakpoints (e.g. `md:`, `lg:` in Tailwind).
2. **Default layout and styles** should target mobile viewports. Add tablet/desktop styles as progressive enhancements.
3. **Touch targets:** Buttons, links, and interactive elements must be large enough and spaced for touch (e.g. min ~44px tap area where possible).
4. **Responsive patterns:** Use mobile-first breakpoints (e.g. single column by default; multi-column or sidebar only from `md:` or `lg:` up). Test that core flows work on a narrow viewport before adding wide-layout refinements.

This applies to all frontend work: auth pages, dashboard, profile, future menu/restaurant UIs, and public menu pages.

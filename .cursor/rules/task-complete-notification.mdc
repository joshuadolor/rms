# Task complete — notify user

When you **finish a task** and **need the user's input** (e.g. confirmation, next step, unblocking decision):

1. End your reply with a clear line such as **"Task complete — need your input."**
2. **Run this command** so the user gets a macOS notification and can switch back to Cursor:

   ```bash
   osascript -e 'display notification "Check Cursor — your input needed." with title "Cursor: Task complete"'
   ```

Do this after completing multi-step work (e.g. develop-module pipeline, bug fix, refactor) so the user can focus elsewhere and know when to intervene.
